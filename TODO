src/fields.cxx:189: Define a reference density. Needs to be replaced once anelastic is there
src/fields.cxx:610: remove these from the model?
src/thermo_vapor.cxx:384: BvS restore getThermoField(), the combination of checkThermoField with getThermoField is more elegant...
src/thermo_moist.cxx:185:                    const double F   = 1.; : test)
src/thermo_moist.cxx:504:                        const double F   = 1.; : test)
src/thermo_moist.cxx:1630: BvS restore getThermoField(), the combination of checkThermoField with getThermoField is more elegant...
src/model.cxx:101: Make an interface that takes this out of the main loop.
src/budget_4.cxx:220: put the correct value for visc here!!!!!
src/budget_4.cxx:228: put the correct value for visc here!!!!!
src/budget_4.cxx:667: implement the proper BC as soon as the full BC's for pressure are added
src/grid.cxx:460: add the vertical component
src/grid.cxx:495: add the vertical component
src/fields.cu:32: use interp2 functions instead of manual interpolation
src/budget_2.cxx:670: : what to do with w2_pres and uw_pres at the top boundary? Pressure at k=kend is undefined?
src/stats.cxx:560: this might not be accurate enough, extrapolate properly
src/stats.cxx:578: the count function assumes that the variable to count is at the mask location
src/diff_smag2.cxx:320: use the thermal expansion coefficient from the input later, what to do if there is no buoyancy?
src/thermo_dry.cxx:299: BvS restore getThermoField(), the combination of checkThermoField with getThermoField is more elegant... 
include/fields.h:98: remove these to and bring them to diffusion model
include/model.h:59: maybe it is safer to create get functions
